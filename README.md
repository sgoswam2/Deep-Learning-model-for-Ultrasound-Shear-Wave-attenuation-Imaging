# Deep-Learning-model-for-Ultrasound-Shear-Wave-attenuation-Imaging
Tissue elasticity is a biomarker used for diagnosis. Elasticity is measured by a dynamic ultrasound imaging technique called [shear wave elasticity imaging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3063441/)(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6684490/). Biological tissue, being viscoelastic,shows dispersive and attaenuating behavior, which affects shear wave speed measurement. Shear wave attenuation is one such factor which attenuates the shear wave speed and affects elasticity and viscoelasticity measurements. Quantitative imaging of Shear wave attenuation is challenging owing to several physics based assumption and cylindrical wave propagation which needs diffraction correction. This project develops a Deep learning method to image shear wave attenuation in heterogeneous tissues.
