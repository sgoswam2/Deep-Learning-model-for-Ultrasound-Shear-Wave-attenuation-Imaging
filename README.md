# Deep-Learning-model-for-Ultrasound-Shear-Wave-attenuation-Imaging
Tissue elasticity is a biomarker used for diagnosis. Elasticity is measured by a dynamic ultrasound imaging technique called [shear wave elasticity imaging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3063441/). Biological tissue, being [viscoelastic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9251283), shows dispersive and attaenuating behavior, which affects shear wave speed measurement. Although imaging of shear wave dispersive behavior has been studied a lot, quantitative imaging of Shear wave attenuation is challenging owing to several physics based and cylindrical wave propagation assumption which needs diffraction correction for heterogeneous tissue (cancerous lesion in surrounding benign medium). This project develops a Deep learning based method to image shear wave attenuation in heterogeneous tissues.
